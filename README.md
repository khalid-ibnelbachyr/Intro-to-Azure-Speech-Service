### App functionality details

This is a template of how you can get started with Azure Speech Services with React.
It contains a basic frontend interface for Speech to text and Text to speech, and an api backend for getting auth tokens, watch the video for more detailed explanations

App is deployed live here, try it out: [intro-speech-app](https://mango-meadow-0ef60e903.2.azurestaticapps.net/)

### App structure

Basically this is a modern React stack with the modern tooling, I used

- React Vite for a basic frontend app
- Azure Functions as a backend
- Tailwind and DaisyUI for styling

```typescript
// Directory
- speech-intro-app
  - api (for proper implementation)
  - components
    - basic (for simple implementation)
    - proper (for proper implementation)
  - App.tsx (entrypoint)
```

> Putting the api inside of the project would allow you to configure an api for your Static Web App

## Use this as a template
> Note: I did not add any authorization token expiry monitoring and refetching logic

- You can find examples online to implement simple token refetching logic on your frontend, I am just storing them as a state for demo purposes but you can store them in local storage, session storage, cookies etc

### How to start

- Run app and functions
  - speech starter app 
    ```powershell
    cd intro-speech-app
    pnpm install
    pnpm dev
    ```
  - functions api
    - use visual studio code functions extension and click on F5 
- Use the Static Web App CLI tool
  - would need some manual changes, I didn't run my setup using this but this demo was deployed to Azure Static Web Apps, so it is definitely possible to configure it

### Notes on deployment

- Make sure to change your api endpoints called from the React app when deploying, if you use SWA they should share the same domain

## Credits

Demo was based of this: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample, you can find an example of token refetching logic here
